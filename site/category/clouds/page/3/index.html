					<div class="post_content">
<p>With multiple cloud providers, possibly including private clouds and internal IT, how do you make this manageable for the user?</p>
<p>How can you create a single user name that can be used across all these services? Ideally, the user needs to login only once. This is often called &#8216;Single sign on&#8217; or SSO.</p>
<p>The big picture answer is <a title="OpenID Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID" target="_blank">OpenID</a>. Cloud services and applications should be separated from the management of identities such as user names. A cloud service needs to be a so-called &#8216;Relying Party&#8217; that relies on an &#8216;Identity Provider&#8217; for checking the users credentials. The standard for this is OpenID. It is a little like Active Directory from Microsoft, except that OpenID works through web services, and allows multiple Identity Providers to co-exist easily.</p>
<p>One of the nice features is that the application does not have to know the password for the user.</p>
<p>You can see it in action on <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/identity/login.bml?type=openid">http://www.livejournal.com/identity/login.bml?type=openid</a> for example.</p>
<p>I am in the process of adding this as a feature to this site, because I do not want to force my subscribers into another account.</p>
<p>Try it out for yourself, and let me know what your experiences are.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the application owner, one of the risks is that the Identity Provider will go out of business. There are a number of mitigation strategies for that, but that might be the topic of another post.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>When I talk or write about cloud computing, the first questions that come to the minds of people are:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do I know my data is stored in a safe way? Think: crashes, outages, viruses, providers going bankrupt etc.</li>
<li>How do I know other people don&#8217;t touch my data? Think: hackers, criminals, our government, another government, the provider.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are very valid and relevant questions. In fact, these have been valid questions for a long time already.</p>
<p>Cloud computing does not create these risks. These risks have been fundamental to information technology, and they have always required attention.</p>
<p>What I teach people in my cloud computing courses is how they can use their existing security framework to evaluate and mitigate cloud risks.</p>
<p>Security risks include confidentiality risks, integrity risks and availability risks. We understand these risks, we are addressing them already in IT. We only need to learn how these risks change in the world of cloud computing, and we need to learn what new ways cloud computing brings in managing these risks.</p>
<p>In some cases, cloud computing would bring unacceptable new risk. In some cases cloud computing will bring new and better ways to handle existing risks.</p>
<p>For example, in the cloud, redundancy is a lot easier.</p>
<p>With these insights it will become possible to properly balance the business benefit of cloud computing with the risks of cloud computing.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>One of my <a title="Store" href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/calendar">course </a>participants came back to me after I wrote about &#8220;<a title="The blurring line between public and private cloud" href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/2012/05/the-blurring-line-between-public-and-private-cloud/">public and private cloud computing</a>&#8220;. His company runs a service where his customers access their digitized paper files. The service runs on servers that they deploy from a hosting provider.</p>
<p>Because of this, they can promise their customers that their data will be in a specific geography. For compliance reasons his customers need this. Customers working from a different geography might work from different servers.</p>
<p>Now, what kind of cloud computing is this? His company has servers dedicated to him.</p>
<p>His customers however are working on shared servers, if they are in the same geography.</p>
<p>There are actually two cloud situations at work here. His customers are using SaaS, as they use an application that runs on shared resources, and they can adjust their usage by self-service. They don&#8217;t control the infrastructure, so to them it is a public cloud service. SaaS is oftentimes not tied to a specific geography, but although cloud computing requires services to be broadly accessible, it is not required that the service is replicated all over the world.</p>
<p>His company however is using something that looks like IaaS, and as the servers are dedicated to them, you could categorize that as private cloud. Though, as the provisioning of these servers requires manual intervention by his provider, it is doubtful whether you should be calling it cloud computing rather than hosting.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>Right after the internet became popular, organizations had their reasons to want private versions of it. Remember the intranet? Looks like the internet, but totally controlled by the company. It is a bit like kindergarten: you can play, but you can’t get out over the fence.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with cloud computing. Companies want ‘safe’ private versions of it. A private cloud is “operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise.” according to the <a title="NIST definition of private cloud" href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/cloud/" target="_blank">NIST definition of private cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Now you might think that a private cloud is not a cloud. Look at the definition of cloud computing: it is supposed to run on shared resources, pay as you go, and self-service set up. A strict company owned private cloud is none of these.  Well, maybe after you have set it all up, getting a new virtual machine might be self-service to some users of this private cloud. But such an infrastructure sits on your balance sheet so you won’t have any of the financial flexibility of public cloud computing.</p>
<p>So, we have public clouds on one end, and private clouds on the other end. True? Not so fast.</p>
<p>The line between public and private cloud is blurring with new products and services out there. VMware, for example, collaborates with service providers to create an ecosystem where workloads can be started on virtual machines in a range of clouds. You could, presumably, run a workload on these products in your own physical datacenter, and move these to a specific private cloud provider who promises you a specific geographic location and hardware dedicated for you, or move them to totally shared infrastructure that probably is a lot more flexible. And you can do this without changing anything in your virtual servers.</p>
<p>As always, cloud computing is about business benefits. This will give the cloud consumer a wide range of options in striking a good balance between compliance and flexibility requirements.</p>
<p>This again shows that for reaping the benefits of cloud computing, a good understanding of the basic concepts is required. If not, you will be cloudwashed by your provider.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>Yep, I have been travelling like crazy recently. See my tweets at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/petersgriddle">http://www.twitter.com/petersgriddle</a></p>
<p>The newest destination was Kuala Lumpur, and it looks like I will be getting back real soon, as I have found some great partners in India and Malaysia. We are easily filling training sessions for cloud as well as virtualization (like private cloud).</p>
<p>Malaysia is a pretty multicultural country, and proud of it. Though there is a sizable and noticeable Muslim population, there is considerable tolerance for other religions. Training in such a country is therefore interesting.</p>
<p>Malaysia still thinks it is a developing country, and wants to become a fully industrialized nation. My feeling is they already are. The Petronas towers were once the highest buildings in the world, and the so-called multimedia super corridor has actually resulted in a large concentration of IT companies. Some of these were represented in my sessions. They tend to work for the region, not so much outside Asia. A number of the software companies are thinking about running their product from a cloud. In order to support these guys I might create a special membership level on my blog to support people who have passed cloud essentials with the application of that knowledge to their work.</p>
<p>These people are likely to &#8216;get it&#8217;, though most may have had limited exposure to the complications of large corporate IT. Some actually told me what they where going to try out immediately after they got back into the office.</p>
<p>Content wise the courses were good too. I am finding ways to do practical hands-on work that are productive and efficient.</p>
<p>All in all a satisfactory trip to look back on.</p>

					<h2 class="headline"><a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/2012/05/why-not-move-your-application-to-the-cloud/" rel="bookmark">Why not move your application to the cloud?</a></h2>
					<div class="post_content">
<p>It never takes long, when I talk with people about cloud computing, before the question comes up. &#8220;How do I move my application to the cloud?&#8221;</p>
<p>Oftentimes, the resistance that lurks in that question points to the hidden question that should be answered first: &#8220;Why should I move my application to the cloud?&#8221;.</p>
<p>And the answer then becomes simple: if there is no business reason to move your application to the cloud, then don&#8217;t do it. I cannot state it more simple. If you see no benefit, don&#8217;t touch it. &#8220;If it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221;.</p>
<p>In my professional career as an IT strategy consultant I have never seen a positive business case for moving an application unchanged to a new platform. There has to be a business driver, the most minimal one being a forced platform or version upgrade.</p>
<p>Businesses (or consultants and vendors!) seeking opportunities for moving applications to the cloud should look for the change imperative. Which compelling reason is there to move?</p>
<p>Examples of such reasons are: severe shortage of modern functionality, serious growth in user base, demand for deploying it to more, and more mobile users, or risky/nonexistent disaster recovery capability. Such situations merit investment in a new application deployment.</p>
<p>But the most interesting application opportunities to focus on are the ones that are &#8216;cloud-native&#8217;: they exist preferably in the cloud. Examples would be analytics on data that is already in the cloud, such as customer behavior statistics, or fundamentally changing the customer experience by complementing it with an online service, such as Xerox&#8217;s CloudPrint.</p>

					<h2 class="headline"><a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/2012/05/bangladesh-cloud/" rel="bookmark">Bangladesh moving into the cloud</a></h2>
					<div class="post_content">
<p>It has been a while since I spent time in developing countries; you know, the countries where I am the only person of European descent around, which makes me stick out like a lighthouse at sea. My tallness only accentuates that. I travelled through India first, delivering training and having some business meetings.  India is a country of extremes where people are sleeping on one side of a totally overcrowded street while the other side of the street might have people living in luxury rivaling that of upper middle class Europeans. Bangladesh is like that, but the luxury is more rare.</p>
<p>My partners at ITpreneurs secured a contract to deliver cloud computing and virtualization training to the Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC), a 500 person agency dedicated to improving the state of the art of IT in the country. The program was financed by JICA, the Japanese development agency, who currently have two volunteers stationed permanently at BCC.</p>
<p>I went in without any notion of what to expect, other than clichés. It was therefore very interesting to see what the ambitions and attitudes of these people were. Getting in on the first morning, we were led into the executive director’s office to have tea with him, while our 25-odd attendants were starting to take their place.  I had seen the attendants list in advance, which featured relatively junior people as well as high ranking officers from the Prime Minister’s Office. Surprisingly, these senior people including the executive director actually spend most of their time in the training, actively participating in all activities including the practical exercises.  They clearly saw the need to get up to speed on these modern developments, and use those as a way to leapfrog into the next generation of IT.</p>
<p>For a trainer, it was an interesting challenge to get such a diverse and big group of people going. They have very different technology backgrounds, their English language command varies, and the social structure needed decoding. However, I think I touched them by being open to their willingness to learn, which they started reciprocating after a few hours. I needed to improvise on the program quite a bit, which they accepted in a constructive way. Some were also not afraid to give me direct feedback. As a result I sometimes made drastic and on the fly changes in delivery.</p>
<p>It took some searching to find out what makes these people tick, but once we got tuned to that, they put a lot of energy into the training and the practical work. Hopefully a number of them will be able to become cloud computing trainers themselves.</p>
<p>Development in these countries goes at a different speed than what people in the west have been used to. The average income is just a few dollars per day, if at all. Yet, more than 50% of the population has a mobile phone, and geographical coverage is near 100%. Remote areas get internet through this network, and the BCC goes through great pains to set up IT labs in as many schools as they can. They also have initiatives for e-commerce and digital government services that rival those of more developed countries.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a very interesting experience. The Bangladeshi, even the high ranking ones, treated me with great respect and took very good care of me (think private drivers and food). It would have been fun to stay longer. Maybe next time, in-shallah, as they too say.</p>
<p>The trip back was fairly smooth, though at the last moment people started to get worried about me getting to the airport in time. Hillary Clinton paid a brief visit to the country, just as I was supposed to go to the same airport, so people assumed some roads might be seriously closed. In all, the trip to the airport was stretched from an optimal 20 minutes to a mere 80 minutes. Another chance to experience the legendary Dhaka traffic jams… Then, just as the plane was about to be pushed back, the entire airport was closed for half an hour by the authorities. Most likely this was related to Hillary and other high visits.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, and on the way back the plane did a fly-by of the Annapurna.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>This week I am honored to train government officials in Bangladesh, most of whom work for the Bangladesh Computer Council. With 25 learners, this is one of my largest groups so far. The scope of the training is Cloud Essentials as well as Virtualization Essentials. As Bangladesh is one of the poorer countries in the world, people here see Cloud Computing as a great opportunity to leapfrog into an IT enabled future.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>In this post on the importance of cloud essentials training, Ron Hogue makes a strong case for this type of training to enhance your career.</p>
<p>You might prefer to watch the video (and you might want to subscribe to his blog or Youtube channel for weekly updates):</p>

<p>As Ron puts it:</p>
<p>Does recent cloud news have your head spinning? Start with Cloud Essentials.</p>
<p>Hi. I’m Ron Hogue. A few days ago, I saw an announcement from VMware, Cisco, and EMC announcing a new training available for cloud computing and virtualization. I thought, “This announcement would be perfect to use to talk about the need for Cloud Essentials certification as a foundation for further cloud training.”</p>
<p>Since that announcement less than two weeks ago, I’ve now seen, related announcements from Citrix talking about the next phase of their CloudStack, EMC talking about their VSPEX, and IBM’s release of PureSystems. So with all these recent announcements, how do you make sense of it all?</p>
<p>Let’s look at how Cloud Essentials can benefit you. First, the education you receive from Cloud Essentials certification program is going to help you understand the terminology and be able to discuss cloud-related initiatives within your organization.</p>
<p>Second, it can be used as the first of many cloud-related certifications that you’ll receive. You’ll want to have the certification to prove your interest and aptitude in the cloud space.</p>
<p>Third, it will help you not only in your current position, but it will also aid you in acquiring your next position. Demand for cloud computing skills and jobs is increasing. Perform a search for cloud computing job trends and see tens of thousands of articles, graphics, and videos all pointing to the fact that companies large and small are hiring those with cloud skills.</p>
<p>Bottom line: if you want to stay current with technology trends, Cloud Essentials is a must.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>The single most often asked question around cloud computing is &#8220;what about security&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yes, what about security?</p>
<p>I have been training people on cloud computing and virtualization for the past 12 months or so based on the ITpreneurs and CompTIA certifications (see my <a title="Store" href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/calendar">cloud course offerings</a>), and I was aware of the CCSK certification. Recently I looked better at it, and found out that by now there is pretty good training material available. So on short notice, I jumped on a plane to Milan to join <a title="Mike Rothman" href="https://securosis.com/blog/incite-4-4-2012-travel-the-barbarian" target="_blank">Mike Rothman teaching the TTT</a> program.</p>
<p>The good news is: the cloud is not so weird that all old rules are no longer valid. Traditional security technology and risk management approaches still apply. The bad news is: there are new risks and new technology to become aware of, and some traditional security tactics no longer work (such as trying to figure out what the physical location of a virtual server is).</p>
<p>The two days of the actual training were packed with a systematic treatment of lots of risks, ways to address them, and practical exercises to illustrate how to build secure cloud applications.</p>
<p>So stay tuned, this course is coming to an instructor near you.</p>
