					<div class="post_content">
<p>Last week, long time Internet pioneer <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/cerfs-up-at-google.html">Vint Cerf</a> signed up to be Google’s chief internet evangelist”. His previous job was with the telecoms firm MCI.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4228910.stm">BBC report</a>, the story concludes with the observation that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The move of such an influential figure is significant<br />in that it marks the way that power in the net world has <br />shifted from telecommunications firms, such as MCI,<br />to companies that do something<br />with that infrastructure, such as Google.</em> </p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>It may seem that way, especially in the light of eBay’s takeover of Skype, and Google’s introduction of Google talk.<br />There is still a large divide between the world of telecommunications and the world of IT applications. Telco’s measure in bits, IT measures in bytes (there is only a factor of 8 difference). With telco’s a kilo is 1000, with IT people it is 1024. This is just the surface. I have made a career out of bridging this gap.</p>
<p>The power struggle alluded to has a long history. Telcos like to see applications, or services, as living ‘in the net’. Think call redirect, think voicemail. The IT people see this net mainly as a pipe that connects users to one another or to their applications, living ‘on the net’. Voice over IP is a case in point. With VOIP, the function of a telephone exchange is no longer the crossroads through which all communications pass, but more like a directory that tells user devices where their counterparts are located (this is SIP, the session initiation protocol).</p>
<p>Yet, with all this predominance of ‘on net’ thinking, people tend to forget that even Skype calls still go over a network, be it wired or wireless.</p>
<p>Is content king? No, it is not, as Odlyzko shows in &#8220;<a href="http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_2/odlyzko/">Content is not king</a>&#8221; but it is on the rise. It is just that it morphs into applications that live ‘on the net’, applications such as Google and eBay.</p>
<p>What does it mean for Google? As shown in <a href="../../../../2005/09/network-the-cost-of-delivering-a-single-web-page/index.html">another of my items</a>, most of the Google budget is spent on things that have no clear immediate business model. With the recruitment of Vint Cerf, and other smart people, Google’s business model seems to be to give enough smart boys enough big toys, and some profitable innovation will come up, sooner or later.</p>
<p>What does that mean for telcos? For one, voice is apparently still profitable, otherwise Google and eBay wouldn’t invest in it. Apart from the obvious fact that running a communications network is still a respectable business, there are lots of services that are complementary to the pipes. ISPs are one, servicing customer networks is one, application acceleration is one. If you control the pipes, have the money, and know how to handle millions and millions of customers, there must be some value in the net.</p>

					<h2 class="headline"><a href="../../../../2005/09/network-the-tipping-point-for-podcasting/index.html" rel="bookmark">[network] The tipping point for podcasting</a></h2>
					<div class="post_content">
<p>Suppose a hundred people get told by an enthusiastic friend to try podcasting. Of these, ten don’t have any hardware on which they can play the podcasts. So the rest goes online, and tries to find interesting content, but only 50 people can find a directory in which they can even start to look for podcasts that they like. Only 40 people then find content that they like, sufficiently. Ten people drop out because they find loading the content too complicated. Of these, another ten find out that the files are too big to play for the hardware they have (for example, just a simple MP3 player, no iPod or similar). Of the ones left, another five don’t have the patience for the downloads. If you have been keeping tabs: we are down to 25 people who are capable and willing to regularly listen to podcasts. Now suppose each of these tells four friends, on the average. That means we are back to a hundred.</p>
<p>Now suppose that all those numbers are a little <em>worse</em> than I have guessed. In that case, any enthusiasm will soon sizzle out. Now suppose that the numbers are just a little <em>better</em>, so that at the end of the week we have 110 people that are going to try subscribing to podcasting. The week after, it will be 121 people trying, and so on. This represents a growth rate of 10% per week, which amounts to more than a hundred fold increase in a year (12,913 people to be exact).</p>
<p>In fact, all these numbers have been getting better gradually over the last several years. Both the technology and the content were existing as early as 1997. Yet, the gradual increase has only last year reached what Malcolm Gladwell calls: “<a href="http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/">The tipping point</a>”, when a development, epidemic, or trend just seems to explode.</p>
<p>Obviously, technology has improved, in particular with the development of the iPod with its huge storage capacity. But something more was going on.</p>
<p>I checked these numbers with Adam Curry, who is regarded by many as the father of podcasting. I found out that he has made a conscious effort to improve the numbers. For example, he developed <a href="http://ipodder.org">ipodder</a>, which started as a piece of software that made the mechanics of subscribing to podcasts and getting them on your player easier. <a href="http://ipodder.org">Ipodder.org/directory</a> is now also a directory to help people find content that is interesting for them. Curry also runs “The Daily Source Code”, a regular podcast, which adds to the available interesting content.</p>
<p>There is a similar tipping point for creators of podcasts. For these, the biggest stumbling block now seems to be the price of bandwidth. I think it need not be that way, but I’ll have to deal with that in a future story.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>Home computing is still too complicated to install and maintain.</p>
<p>Last week my neighbours asked for my advice on getting ADSL to their home, as their teen daughter is driving up the phone bill with her Internet usage. Even though they can opt for having the entire stuff installed by the ADSL provider, they are still baffled by the prospect of the inhouse wiring (here is a reason for WiFi, if ever there was one). In fact they are stalling on the purchase of an upgraded computer, because they are afraid of what to do with it if they mess it up.</p>
<p>I heard a similar story from my sister and her husband. They are delaying an upgrade as well, and they are even willing to pay for serious after sales service if they mess up their Windows.</p>
<p>Mind you, between these people there are 3 Ph.D&#8217;s., one of which is about a serious database application.</p>
<p>Somehow some things are still missing in this space.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>At the closing ceremony of What The Hack Rop Gonggrijp reflected on the event. He opened by congratulating the 1500+ attendants: “We pulled it off!”. It had not been easy to organise the event, partly because of misconceptions about the relation of hackers to society. These hackers are not anti-social, they just tune to different social conventions (like everybody tries to express his identity). It is true that the gender bias is very male, and the dress code is vagabond style, but most of them are very capable of functioning in social situations. In fact, I have never seen an event on this scale organised by volunteers, and the feeling of community, sharing and collaboration is just tremendous. As one person noted: “This is the only place were I can leave my notebook computer on a table in the bar, and expect to find it back the following morning”.  These people’s identities are skills based, not asset or power based. They are hunters, more than farmers.</p>
<p>As this is the 5th event like this in a row, we see a more mature community. The people attending are of all ages. They still look like bums, but that is because they are among themselves. In their day jobs they could be professional programmers, or security consultants, and some are quite successful at that, judging from the cars in the parking lot.</p>
<p>The final image I have of the event is of Rop, as he stepped down from the stage, and was hugged by his wife and children who were on the front row. All these people have families who take pride in the fact that their loved ones are living out their purpose in life. At least I felt that way when I got home.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>Sometimes, a memory from the past comes back.<br />I remember walking around Washington square park in Manhattan, it must have been around 1987 as I was living in New Jersey (the ultra west side :-)), appreciating the street artists. The talent mix was incredibly wide, from jugglers keeping 7 balls in the air to kids banging on trash cans. Somewhere there was this guy with a guitar singing the blues. I remember his lines verbatim, almost 20 years later:</p>
<blockquote><p>My life is like the water<br />It&#8217;s going down the drain<br />I&#8217;m gonna take a shotgun, baby<br />and disconnect my brain</p></blockquote>
<p>Now there is a fine piece of blues lyrics for you. The most striking feature is that it uses the word `disconnect&#8217;, which is a networking word. At the time there were 20.000 to 30.000 computers on the Internet. Even for elite universities, having an Internet connection was something to brag about. Equally notable is that this usage draws upon metaphores that were fairly modern then in artificial intelligence, and later popularized in the movie &#8220;The Matrix&#8221;. On top of that there is a deliberate confusion between this metaphorical level and the physical level. After all, this is how Ernest Hemingway committed suicide.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>Sometimes you see television that makes you wonder.<br />This morning I watched, from the corner of my eye, a television cartoon my children were watching. The main character, Andy, is a highschool kid who likes to set up practical jokes. As one of these jokes fails in preparation, his punishment is to spend a day in a kindergarten class. He is obviously not happy with that situation. After a break (commercial?) we see him and the kids lying on the floor resting. We see them from above, through the blades of an ceiling fan.</p>
<p>His line is: &#8220;Kindergarten, shit, still in Kindergarten.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a reference to the opening scene from Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/">Apocalypse Now!</a>&#8221; movie on Vietnam. Captain Willard&#8217;s mission starts with him waking up from a dream on helicopters, looking at a fan in a hotel room, and saying: &#8220;Saigon, shit, still only in Saigon.&#8221; I could rant on for hours on this movie alone, but I digress.</p>
<p>Now why in the world would the creator of this Andy story put in this reference? It is absolutely incomprehensible to children, the primary audience. Heck, I even have colleagues who weren&#8217;t born at the time (the movie is from 1979, well over 25 years ago).</p>
<p>I have a few ideas, but please share yours.</p>
<p>One possibility is that it is a joke of the creator, for his peers. This is not uncommon, even software writers do this (they call such a hidden joke an Easter egg). Another hypothesis is that this is a way to keep kids movies interesting for adults, who find themselves watching this stuff, voluntarily or not. Disney family movies are known for this, for example by having a soundtrack with music that cannot have meaning to the kids, but brings back memories to their parents (think sixties music).<br />So, what are your ideas?</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>Is blogging something new? I wonder. As you notice, I have done some experiments in blogging lately, and it is really a becoming a big hype. So, why is that? There are two reasons I can think of. One, it is content management trivialised. Two, it is a scalable alternative to netnews.</p>
<p>The technology of blogging (short for weblogging) allows for fast and easy updates of a website. It is an ASP approach to content management. You change your blog through a website interface. Fancier versions, such as Google&#8217;s Blogger, even allow you to e-mail stuff to the blog, or push it from a photo management site such as <a href="http://www.fototime.com/">http://www.fototime.com/</a>. The price you pay for this simplicity is reduced website structuring and layout opportunities, but we seem to have had it with experimental design anyway. Keeping a weblog is not particular new. A lot of people have been keeping diaries on the Internet for a long time. As an example look at my dad&#8217;s <a href="http://www.van-eyk.net/gerard/dagboek">www.van-eyk.net/gerard/dagboek</a> which has been going on since 1999.</p>
<p>The hype around blogging is based on the growing importance of non-professional or independent news makers, who challenge the industry. I guess the volume of this has gone up, and thus the importance. To some extent this is helped by a technology that often accompanies blogging: RSS. RSS (allegedly stands for real simple syndication) is a way to let automatic tools check out &#8216;what&#8217;s new&#8217;. In the early days of networking, and actually outside of the Internet, netnews was a way to push news, written by netnews users, to servers around the world.</p>
<p>When I first got in touch with netnews, there were around 500 newsgroups, and all that news could be pushed through a dial-up connection. I stopped counting around 20.000 when some Internet providers had to dedicate fulltime staff just to keep it flowing. Newsnet was, and still is, organised in newsgroups with a name such as rec.humor.funny. The role of these groups is now taken over by websites that aggregate news, and blogs, which effectively are moderated newsgroups. RSS facilitates that, and an RSS reader will effectively take the place of the newsreader. In the past, the news was stored locally on a server. Currently, it is pulled directly from the source. There aren&#8217;t a lot of local servers anymore, and everybody is mostly online anyway. RSS&#8217;s main contribution to the mechanics of media hype is that it allows fast and automatic notification of changes. With this comes the opportunity for flamewars, which we know so well from email and netnews. So we are back full circle.</p>
