					<div class="post_content">
<p>Last night, somebody broke into my house and took my mobile phone, wallet (with bankcards and credit cards), and some other valuable stuff (but little of emotional value). Curiously, a laptop and passports where untouched. It awoke me again to the risks that are part of our highly IT dependent life.</p>
<p>Although the laptop was not taken, I felt very relieved that I had just completed installing <a href="http://www.mozy.com/?ref=3f9a896b&#038;kbid=12505">Mozy</a> on it. You don’t want to lose all your work, digital photography etc, in this way. Mozy is a remote backup service that I wrote about earlier. I am still very happy with it.</p>
<p>As for the importance of your digital identity: without money, bankcards or phone, you are more or less a nobody. I had to cancel my appointments because I effectively cannot travel.</p>
<p>I am a little uneasy about my mobile phone. It is in sync with my outlook contacts database, which means I have not lost any info. On the other hand, somebody now has a digital repository with details of hundreds of my contacts. It is a good thing I did not have any passwords stored in the device. I&#8217;ll pay close attention to the encryption and security features when I buy the replacement phone.</p>
<p>Finally, some documents were stolen with our social security numbers on them. Unlike mobile phone numbers or bank accounts, there is no way to revoke a social security number. It is a major ID theft risk to have these numbers published so widely.  I don&#8217;t see the need for everybody and his brother to put this number on their cards.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>Does it matter much how digital music is coded and compressed? Theoretically, more bandwidth leads to more expression and better sound quality.  Of all songs, I could only hear a difference between the CD version of a song and the mp3 version in Bach’s cantata “Wachet Auf” (BMV 140), in the part where the orchestra throws in all its instruments, and the basses, tenors and sopranos max out.</p>
<p>“Wachet Auf” is traditionally performed in the Catholic Church at this time of the year. It was the final song at the funeral of my mother who died today one year ago.<br />(100 words)</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>Last week the Dutch consumer rights organization &#8216;Consumentenbond&#8217; proposed to make computer companies and internet service providers responsible for the security of home computers. The majority of home computer users has had security incidents in the past 12 months, and is not capable of accurately describing the most important computer security threats. See also my previous blog entry <a href="../../../../2006/10/an-unsolved-problem-in-digital-home-infrastructures/index.html">here</a> on wireless security.</p>
<p>The industry&#8217;s reaction to this proposal is fairly predictable: users have their own responsibility. According to Microsoft, if the industry is made responsible, users can no longer have the opportunity to install arbitrary new software on their PC&#8217;s, or participate in certain online networks. Furthermore Internet power users would react strongly against a &#8216;neutered&#8217; internet connection.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I know quite a few people who would willingly trade in flexibility for safety, and a market for &#8216;safe computing&#8217; might exist. After all, these techniques are also used by my corporate clients to reduce their IT cost.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>Yesterday I met with a company in Paris to progress a business opportunity, on which I will report later. They are deploying a computing device in customer homes, which connects by wifi to the Internet. Some people call this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_intelligence">&#8216;ambient intelligence</a>&#8216;. The connectivity is absolutely essential to the operation of the device. However, it turns out that it is not easy to deploy.</p>
<p>A few years ago, wifi stations in residential settings were typically wide open, as various stories about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving">&#8216;war-driving</a> the neighbourhood&#8217; show.</p>
<p>In fact, in the Paris apartment were I stay, I can pick up a wifi network named after a big brand manufacturer who shall remain nameless. This indicates that the network was deployed out of the box, unprotected, not secured. These days, wifi often comes bundled with an broadband internet connection. Some consider the massive deployment of open access points a criminal act because it exposes unprotected home computers to systematic hacking. It does to computer viruses what unsafe sex does to HIV.</p>
<p>Currently a number of techniques are used by Internet providers to deploy these devices. Wanadoo France (now Orange) used to secure the wifi stations, and give them all unique names and passwords. Another ISP I know of leaves the networks open, but gives them a random name, and hides that. This then in effect becomes a password.</p>
<p>All in all, these techniques try to strike a balance between usability and safety. It is a password distribution problem, and residential users are notoriously bad in handling passwords.</p>
<p>This situation does not make it easy for the company to have its users deploy their devices. In fact, they estimate that in 20-30% of the cases the customer does not succeed in connecting the device. The fact that the device does not have a keyboard makes it no easier.</p>
<p>What would be a solution for this problem? There are technical approaches and managerial approaches. Comparable problems exist in other wireless deployments: Dect phones, wireless keyboards, Bluetooth devices. A similar solution could be engineered, but it requires a feature in the wifi base stations. Another inroad is working with the party who deploys the base stations. There are two major providers in France, but such an approach does not scale worldwide.</p>
<p>What other ideas can you think of?</p>

					<h2 class="headline"><a href="../../../../2006/09/directories-are-also-infrastructures/index.html" rel="bookmark">Directories are also infrastructures</a></h2>
					<div class="post_content">
<p>One of the big projects I am working on right now is directory services for identity management. In these directories digital identities such as loginnames, addresses, access rights, etc. are stored. With an adequately structured directory service, the proper management of access rights becomes a lot easier, which translates into cost savings and better security.</p>
<p>Examples of these include the internet&#8217;s Domain Name System (DNS) and Microsoft&#8217;s Active Directory. A lot of organizations however, have requirements beyond these systems, and for these a wide range of custom solutions are used.</p>
<p>In order to improve on that, we must see directories as infrastructures. The management of user names, their access rights and personal preferences can be separated from the applications and consolidated into a single directory. As an example, you can think of one login name to use for multiple independent websites. This will allow users to work with only a single digital identity, and it will allow systems management to have better control over who accesses what. As this infrastructure is separated from its applications one will get all the usual issues: it becomes more important to specify the services, the service levels, and the way in which demand is matched with supply.</p>
<p>Directories as infrastructures also differ from other infrastructures. Although the technical operation can often be centralized, the management of the actual user information is delegated in a hierarchical way. In addition, access control on the information in the directory itself, who can read or modify what, is very fine-grained.</p>
<p>All in all, we see that creating a directory infrastructure requires a lot of attention to management issues. Furthermore, it would make an interesting business case study as to why public directories for identities are not gaining a lot of traction. Examples of such public directories are TypeKey and Microsoft&#8217;s Passport.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>Network neutrality has become the topic of intense discussion and legislative action.<br />See the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/21/AR2006012100094.html">Washington Post</a> , a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality">Wikipedia article</a>, and <a href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/network_neutrality/">CircelID</a>.</p>
<p>What is the issue?</p>
<p>On the one hand people argue for &#8216;universal service&#8217; that say that one person&#8217;s bits should not be treated differently from another person&#8217;s. This compares to the idea that the phone company should not be allowed to treat your calls differently depending on what you want to say, or that red haired people would have a different monthly fee. There are laws against this type of discrimination (at least in most nations), and some people want to extend this law to Internet traffic. On the other hand there are some Internet providers who want to charge different customers different rates for different service. &#8220;We can&#8217;t have companies freeloading on our expensive pipes&#8221;, they claim.</p>
<p>Clearly we seem to want both. We don&#8217;t want the phone companies to decide which traffic gets carried, and we also don’t want a bland one-size-fits-all service that is expensive for some and inadequate for others.</p>
<p>My idea is that the issue is a bit oversimplified, and will become more clear if we use the right model of who connects to whom, as well as who pays who. This model recognizes three types of players, instead of one or two as we were used to.</p>
<p>There is the client ISP, which connects the access devices such as PCs, and the server ISP, which connects the website hosting to the network. They both charge money to the owners of the respective devices. Their interconnection is either direct, or through so called &#8216;transit providers&#8217;. They both typically pay the transit provider (unless the ISP is really big, in which case it can probably negotiate free transit with equally big ISPs).</p>
<p>To me it seems that the discussion on net neutrality can be framed in the following way. Can the client ISP charge the ISP of a specific server? I.e. can AOL charge Yahoo and not Google, for providing the bandwidth for videos? This would seem odd, as the entire service of hooking up Yahoo and Google is already provided by the transit provider. At the same time, AOL can charge the home customer more for higher speed service. The same holds for the provider of the hosting company.</p>
<p>So the question will then be reduced to: can a provider charge another provider with which it does not have a direct business relationship as mentioned above?</p>

<p>New technology brings new risks. We used to think that data was safe behind big walls in high-security datacenters. Then came the internet.

So were the bad guys, hacking into computer systems, stealing data. Firewalls have contained this problem, more or less.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/01/opinion/01sat2.html?ex=1152417600&#038;en=577184ece9645dc0&amp;amp;amp;ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1">New York Times editorial</a> draws attention to a new round of problems in data protection. A couple of months ago a laptop was stolen with identity information of some 17 million veterans. Any crook with this kind of information at his hands would have a field day committing identity fraud, for example by registering credit cards in the names of these people and abusing them.</p>
<p>The US government estimates that the damage control cost for this incident could be more than $ 160 million, and that is just for one year of credit monitoring alone. So, one stolen laptop is worth more than $ 160 million dollars. Somebody must be very relieved that the laptop was recovered, apparently without the information having been used illegally (but how would they know?).</p>
<p>This is not an isolated incident. A typical medium sized company loses several laptops a year, and I have heard first hand stories of business contracts being terminated as the result of losing data in this way. It cannot be very hard to justify the business case for better data protection, yet we can expect more of this to happen real soon now.</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t we have this problem much earlier? To me, this is another example of a <em>critical mass phenomenon</em>. In this case it is the size of the hard disk of the notebooks that allows them to carry a full database worth. This was pretty hard just a couple of years ago. The point is that a gradual change in a certain capacity can suddenly cross a tipping point. I have <a href="../../../../2005/09/network-the-tipping-point-for-podcasting/index.html">elaborated on a similar example </a>in relation to podcasting.</p>
