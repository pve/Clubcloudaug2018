					<div class="post_content">
<p>Virtualization technology has great promises for IT applications to run better, faster, cheaper, and more flexible. But that won’t happen by just buying the latest and greatest product.</p>
<p>Today’s digital infrastructures consists of dozens or even hundreds of servers, Terabytes if not Petabytes of storage spread over multiple storage arrays, and potentially thousands of desktops, laptops, tablets and other devices. These infrastructures serve thousands of users with hundreds of different applications. They are supported by operational teams that are typically grouped by technical ‘silo’: server, network, storage, etc.</p>
<p>Managing these digital infrastructures properly while keeping agility up and costs down is a major challenge for IT departments.</p>
<p>This challenge leads to high cost, inflexible service, long lead times for projects and overworked support departments.</p>
<p>Who is going to help you get out of that mess? Vendors? Consultants?</p>
<p>Sure, vendors understand technology, but mostly their own technology. And there are probably no vendors that have a full suite of software that is a good fit for your situation. And how would you know? Infrastructure solutions are notorious for solving problems only partly. Look at how many versions Microsoft Windows had to go through before it was good enough for production use. Even today, an efficient Windows based IT platform needs a lot of add-on software to make it manageable. While all of that technology may be a smart solution in the space it was designed for, chances are high that it either falls short of what your organization needs, or is too expensive or cumbersome to manage.</p>
<p>Let’s face it. The basic technology that is used to run IT on these days is based on PCs. Single user, single box devices, running a few applications only. Only gradually has technology been added to be able to manage thousands of these to be used as a flexible set of resources capable of being adapted quickly to changing requirements.</p>
<p>Most of this technology is grouped under the name of ‘virtualization technology ‘. But we now have server virtualization, storage virtualization, desktop virtualization, network virtualization, application virtualization and more. All of which is introduced to compensate some characteristic of PC technology and make it more usable for large scale IT deployment.</p>
<p>Now what about bringing in some expensive consultants to shed some light on your IT? Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that they are good, knowledgeable, and vendor independent. That still does not solve the problem that the internal IT department is often siloed in traditional IT disciplines. Virtualization is about new ways of consolidating IT to make it more flexible and resilient. For example, using a combination of server virtualization and storage virtualization the risk of server crashes can largely be eliminated. Getting that to work requires IT teams to work together across silos. Getting them to work together requires that they have a common understanding of virtualization’s potential as well as the new risks.</p>
<p>This is the challenge that the Virtualization Essentials course was designed for. It enables senior IT specialists, architects and service managers (to name just the core jobs) to work together on the successful and profitable adoption of virtualization.</p>
<p>The Virtualization Essentials course is a 2-day, interactive, classsroom-based learning experience. The course provides a balanced curriculum and addresses the business perspective, the technical organization, and operating and governing virtualization. The course enables participants to successfully complete the associated Foundation exam.</p>
<p>For more information on the contents of the course, visit http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/virtualization-essentials/</p>
<p>You can rely on me to deliver this learning experience. I am one of the most experienced vendor neutral cloud trainers in the world, and I have trained over 100 individuals, and more than 40 candidate cloud trainers.

					<div class="post_content">
<p>What a ride it has been over the past weeks! I delivered a cloud training almost every week, cloud security as well as cloud essentials. I was out of the office a lot: locations in the Netherlands, France and Dubai. And as I write this I am at the Vienna airport after an interesting EuroCMG meeting, where I got to present on cloud costing.</p>
<p>In Dubai I was at the Gitex conference, the largest IT exhibition and trade show in the region, which welcomed 145.000 visitors last year. After the cloud conference that was part of it I got to do a one day Cloud Security (CCSK) workshop. The organizers sold out the 50 seat room. It was the largest class I ever did.</p>
<p>The questions these people had were generally about how to get into the cloud, though for some getting into the cloud was equivalent to putting their servers in somebody else’s data centers  Apparently there is little experience here with outsourcing in general, even if only for housing.</p>
<p>In comparison to other regions I find the concern about network connectivity relatively high. That makes sense, as the Gulf region is fairly far away from most of the important data center locations in the world (think Amazon), and the world’s biggest internet pipes radiate out of north-America, spanning the big oceans, opposite of this region.</p>
<p>To my courses and presentations now come people that have a basic understanding of cloud computing. This makes part of my job easier. Nevertheless, people do not always interpret the basic cloud definitions correctly.</p>
<p>Advancing cloud awareness means I will be doing some planning on the next line of courses and workshops. Topics include: how do I figure out what applications my company is running in the cloud, and have these conform to whatever policies I might have.  Another cry for help I hear at times is: “My CEO has defined a ‘cloud first’ strategy, it is now my job to implement that policy and I am clueless as to where to start.”</p>
<p>The current status of cloud knowledge is also such that I have decided to re-target my mailing list. Rather than catering for people who want a basic introduction to cloud computing, I will focus on people who want to apply that basic knowledge to their own business. For people that have passed cloud certifications I have other plans. Stay tuned.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>So you want to run a private cloud? Here are a few steps to take for you to make this a success.</p>
<p>The first step is to answer the question: why? Which business benefits of cloud computing are you after and why can’t you use public cloud solutions to fulfill them?</p>
<p>If you want to set up a private cloud to keep your existing system admins busy, you need to think again. Private cloud is a lot harder then it seems, especially if you want to do it right. You will need to invest in your IT staff.</p>
<p>The two main reasons for operating a private cloud infrastructure solely for your organization are capacity guarantees and security/compliance.</p>
<p>On top of that you are likely to want the business advantages that stem from public clouds’ essential characteristics: broad network access, rapid elasticity, measured service, on-demand self-service and resource pooling. Even though you won’t pool resources with other organizations, if you don’t share resources over business units and projects, there will be little benefit.</p>
<p>Once you know these expected benefits and characteristics you can move to phase two. You translate these into the features of your private cloud, and you need to figure out what processes and tooling you need.</p>
<p>You probably want metering and chargeback, automated configuration and self-service provisioning. These do not come with your basic VMware license. They require separate software, and processes to run them across projects and applications. Next, think of the skilled staff necessary for its set up and operation.</p>
<p>All of this is not trivial to do. Take for example security. Traditional security measures based on segmented networks and fixed firewalls no longer apply. And you are creating a new and very sensitive role: the private cloud administrator with top level root access.</p>
<p>Then in the third phase, you can start to move your applications to your private cloud. This is where your benefits are going to be. But expect a bumpy ride, not all applications move easily to the cloud.</p>
<p>If you need more detailed inside into private cloud, you can consider my Virtualization Essentials course, which covers server, storage and application virtualization and more.</p>

					<h2 class="headline"><a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/2012/09/cloud-computing-for-developing-a-country-like-bangladesh/" rel="bookmark">Cloud computing for developing a country like Bangladesh</a></h2>
					<div class="post_content">
<p>Is a country like Bangladesh to benefit from cloud computing, and if so, how? This week I wrapped up training new instructors for Cloud Essentials and Virtualization Essentials in Dhaka, Bangladesh. (<a title="Bangladesh moving into the cloud" href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/2012/05/bangladesh-cloud/">see earlier post</a> for my previous visit). At first glance there is little doubt that this country can benefit. After all, cloud computing and virtualization promises lower cost and faster deployment than traditional IT. And developing countries have little money to spend and no time to lose.</p>
<p>Two studies published this week provide context to this question. The <a href="http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2012-2013/">2012-2013 competitiveness report</a>  shows that Bangladesh is slipping on the list of competitive economies, partly because of poor infrastructure. Another study shows that <a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/article/00127?pg=all">increased digitization correlates with higher economic growth</a>.</p>
<p>So the imperative is there. But where to start? This was the topic of some of the discussions that I had with my students and with staff of the Bangladesh Computer Council, industry representatives and very senior government officials.</p>
<p>The initial cloud thoughts of most organizations around the world start at their current application portfolio. Typically they discover that it is a lot of work to move an existing application to the cloud, while at the same time that very often does not improve the risk profile of the application. So, plan A fails, time for plan B.</p>
<p>Cloud computing is part of a bigger shift, which is that the “center of gravity” of digital data is moving outside of corporations and into a wider ecosystem of companies, service providers, communities and individuals. Think of Wikipedia and all the actors and machinery that are involved in making it work. Success in cloud computing is more likely to occur in this new space.</p>
<p>Back to developing countries, who need to raise the level of education, their infrastructure and their IT industry. What initiative would enable that? Bangladesh already has a network of computer classrooms at the regional level. A new government network is scheduled to bring Internet connectivity to more than 14.000 offices. Half the people have mobile phones already and smartphones are on the rise. I have been told that there is a successful process of local teachers producing local content for their students.</p>
<p>This indicates that there is a critical mass for a next wave of innovation. I foresee a model where private companies, with some government support, develop innovative local learning solutions to tap into teacher generated content to improve learning efficiency for local students.</p>
<p>Such an initiative would be superior to imported software or existing cloud solutions because it will be in a local language and will be optimized to the existing internet speeds and (mobile) devices. Low speed internet is better than no internet. After all, the dot com boom was built on millions of people having internet at dial-up speeds.</p>
<p>If this takes off, it will improve learning for a very large student population, it will strengthen the business case for investing in higher internet speeds, it will result in more practical cloud application development experience across the country and a strengthened local software industry.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>Last week I delivered a two-day <a title="CCSK ‘Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge’ Course" href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/ccsk-certificate-of-cloud-security-knowledge-course">CCSK (certificate of cloud security knowledge)</a> in Kuala Lumpur. The typical structure of this training, as suggested by the Cloud Security Alliance, calls for a day of lecture followed by a day of practical exercises.  However, I mixed lecture with case study and exercise, because I have experienced that this works much better. If the examples have been worked through by the individuals, it becomes easy to refer back to them in the lectures.</p>
<p>It was good to be back in KL (the<a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/2012/05/cloud-computing-in-kuala-lumpur/"> last time</a> I taught Cloud Essentials and Virtualization Essentials).  I really like the Asian atmosphere, the multicultural vibe of Malaysians, Chinese, Indian and even some European people. All of these were represented in my course too. It was great working with them, even though we sometimes have to get used to our accents.</p>
<p>Cloud security as a topic is pretty new, but interest is already growing rapidly. I am happy with my KL partners and hope to be back in November for more cloud courses.

					<div class="post_content">
<p>How good is ‘Google Sites’ as a web hosting platform?</p>
<p>For my contribution to the Computer Measurement Group’s (CMG) yearly conference (<a title="CMG las Vegas" href="http://www.cmg.org/conference/" target="_blank">CMG Las Vegas 2012</a>) I am reviewing a number of webhosting options. One of the basic options is ‘Google Sites’, which is a content management system (CMS) with hosting and a content distribution network, all rolled into one. You can have a reasonable website running in a few minutes, just add content. It is sort of an alternative to blog hosting on wordpress.com or posterous.com. And it is free.</p>
<p>The obvious question then is: how good is it, and what kind of load will it sustain? First some basic results: one of my sites is hosted at Google Sites, and it failed 15 out of 8611 tests in June 2012, which is an uptime better than 99.8%. The average load time of the first request is under 900 milliseconds, though it differs a bit by location. The load time of the full page is a bit longer. This takes around 1.5 seconds to start rendering and 2.5 seconds to be fully loaded. See <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/120706_VE_BTR/" target="_blank">http://www.webpagetest.org/result/120706_VE_BTR/</a> for a breakdown of the site download.</p>
<p>A more interesting question is: how does it scale? Can it handle more load than a dedicated server?</p>
<p>A regular dedicated server will run at more than 100 requests/second. If a web page visit results in 10 requests, this means such a server will deliver at least 10 pageviews per second, which sounds good enough for a typical blog. Most vanity bloggers will be happy to have 10 pageviews per hour :-).</p>
<p>Here is what I did, step by step. I started by creating a page on a fresh domain at Google sites. With <a href=" http://jmeter.apache.org/index.html" target="_blank">Jmeter</a> I set up a little script to poll for that page. This script was then uploaded to <a href="https://cloudmonitor.nimsoft.com/" target="_blank">WatchMouse</a>, for continuous performance evaluation, and to <a href="http://blazemeter.com/" target="_blank">Blazemeter</a> for load testing. After an initial trial with a single server we fired 8 servers with 100 threads (simulated users) each.</p>
<p>You can see the result in the next graph. You will see Google Sites easily handling over 150 requests per second, with a bandwidth of 3 Megabyte/second. Each request is a single HTTP request.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blazing.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-700" title="blazing" src="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blazing-300x134.png" alt="" width="300" height="134" srcset="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blazing-300x134.png 300w, http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blazing.png 974w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Interestingly, Google Sites does some kind of rate limiting, as we can see in the next picture. As the number of simulated users increases, the response time increases as well, already at low volumes. There is no ‘load sensitivity point’ indicative of resource depletion.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blazing2.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-701" title="blazing2" src="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blazing2-300x117.png" alt="" width="300" height="117" srcset="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blazing2-300x117.png 300w, http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blazing2.png 972w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>In the next picture you can see that the response rate just levels off.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blazing3.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-702" title="blazing3" src="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blazing3-300x116.png" alt="" width="300" height="116" srcset="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blazing3-300x116.png 300w, http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blazing3.png 972w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>In fact, it is even likely that Google Sites is rate limiting by source IP address. While this test was ran, the independent monitoring by WatchMouse showed no correlated variation.</p>
<p>Some final technical notes: If you want to maximize the requests/second you need lots of threads/simulated users with delays built-in. Jmeter is not good at simulating users that don’t have delays.</p>
<p>By the way, the site under test was served by more than 40 different IP addresses. The site has low latency to places around the world: for example locations in Ireland, China, San Francisco, Malaysia all have connect times less than 5 milliseconds. This substantiates the statement that Google Sites is using some kind of CDN.</p>

					<h2 class="headline"><a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/2012/07/which-is-faster-cloudfront-or-s3/" rel="bookmark">Which is faster: Cloudfront or S3?</a></h2>
					<div class="post_content">
<p>Amazon Web Services&#8217; S3 can be a pretty good and cheap approach to webhosting, serving files at a cost of  cents per 1000 hits.</p>
<p>How much of an improvement would it be to serve these files out of Amazon&#8217;s Cloudfront, the content delivery service that caches content around the world?</p>
<p>Here are the results of a brief experiment. In the month of June I served a 1.3 Megabyte sound file both from S3 and from Cloudfront to the WatchMouse monitoring network. I then measured the minimum time to connect, as well as the average download time for the two, and compared those across the locations from where they were downloaded.</p>
<p>The next table shows the minimum connect times in milliseconds.</p>

<p>What is noticeable is that the connect time to the S3 service increases with the geographical distance from Ireland, which is where the main file is hosted. The connect time to S3 is much more constant and a lot lower. This is good for web users waiting for their webpage to build up.</p>

<p>Again, we see that the S3 download times correlate with distance, and Cloudfront download times being much more constant across the world, as well as being consistently lower.</p>
<p>From a business perspective, it makes sense to use Cloudfront as it will deliver a better user experience, but be aware that Cloudfront costs can be between a bit smaller than S3 costs and up to two times higher.</p>

					<h2 class="headline"><a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/2012/06/bad-neighbors-in-the-cloud/" rel="bookmark">Bad neighbors in the cloud</a></h2>
					<div class="post_content">
<p>What do you do when somebody comes to live next door and spoils the whole neighborhood? They leave, you leave or you learn to live with it.</p>
<p>What does that have to do with cloud computing? I will give you an example.</p>
<p>This site is currently hosted on an Amazon EC2 virtual machine (VM). In all likelihood, there are other VMs hosted on the same physical machine. Let&#8217;s call these other VMs neighbors.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks I had several occasions where this site was really slow, for extended periods, like 20 minutes. Deeper inspection revealed that a lot of the CPU time was reported as &#8216;stolen&#8217;. See here for more <a href="http://adrianotto.com/2010/02/time-stolen-from-a-virtual-machine/" target="_blank">explanation on stolen CPU time</a>. Looking  further over a period of time with tools such as<a href="https://newrelic.com/" target="_blank"> NewRelic</a> leads to the hypothesis that another VM on that physical machine is running CPU bound batches. That is a <strong>bad neighbor</strong>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to live with this, and I cannot force this neighbor out. So I have to move. This turned out to be easier than I thought. On Amazon EC2 my VM is running with EBS storage, which means its &#8216;hard disk&#8217; exists even if the VM is gone. The VM instance also has a so-called Elastic IP address, which is independent of the physical machine.</p>
<p>So I stopped the VM, and restarted it. It then landed on a different physical machine with different neighbors. Users saw only a brief interruption, nothing worse than what we were going through anyway.</p>
<p>With proper load balancing, users would not notice it at all. Apparently, Netflix is reportedly doing the same thing: killing VMs that have landed in bad neighborhoods.</p>
