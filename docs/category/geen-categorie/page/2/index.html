					<div class="post_content">
<p>The question I am working on is this. How can IT leaders drive the right level of cloud adoption? We know cloud computing can bring risks and benefits. But how can organizations swiftly and securely do the right level of adoption?</p>
<h2>No place for bean counters</h2>
<p>When I talk about IT leaders I don’t mean the bean counter who is only trying to keep IT cost down. That is not the skill set that this article is about.</p>
<p>In an age where arguably every business is innovating through IT, a whole different skill set is required.</p>
<p>The IT leaders I am talking about are the ones whose mission it is to support the business goals and ambitions of their organizations. Their job is to use information technology to the maximum while staying within the flight envelop given by the organization’s risk appetite.</p>
<p>I suspect that this requires deep understanding of information technology and its risks.</p>
<p>The first question might be: why should we embrace the right level of cloud adoption?</p>
<p>My answer to that is that it depends on how digitally infused you are. If you company is mainly ‘brick and mortar’, cloud computing can lead to cost savings, if done right. But if your business is dependent on digital communication with customers, suppliers and other stakeholders, it will depend on its capacity to adapt its IT systems quickly. For that, cloud computing brings agility. And therefore IT leadership’s role includes enabling that agility for the business.</p>
<h2>IT leaders</h2>
<p>Who is actually leading IT and the company IT strategy? At first sight you might be talking about who sets the budget, and oversees the staff. For example: what CRM system to invest in? In the end, the CIO is supposed to control that.</p>
<p>But that ignores a whole set of decisions on the long term direction of IT. Although IT is a dynamic and rapidly changing field, it is also know for dragging along a lot of legacy. Anecdotes abound about COBOL mainframe applications that have been unchanged for decades, and production systems that are running on Windows XP. Yet, at the time those where sound innovative decisions.</p>
<p>To be truly innovative requires making decisions on the future direction of technology and how the company is going to benefit from it. These decisions will impact the organization of IT way beyond the next budget cycle.</p>
<p>And if it is innovative, it is also unproven: “No risk, no fun”, “No pain, no gain”. It requires taking calculated risks that can have a large upside, yet fit within the risk appetite of the company as a whole. It requires making choices about what to adopt and what not.</p>
<p>These choices require a reasonably detailed understanding of new technology and the risks that it can bring. The better you understand the risks, the better the balance you can strike. Better brakes allow your car to go faster.</p>
<p>The competences to make these decisions are most likely to be found in the IT architects and IT risk managers. It might be in the skill set of the CIO, but I find that rare.</p>
<p>The required leadership skills not only extend to technology decisions. Every change in the structure of technology requires a change in the structure of the organization. Old silo’s fade away, new skill sets, tasks, and responsibilities set in. Nowhere is this more clear than in the uptake of cloud computing. Parts of the responsibility of running IT are outsourced as well as changed in service model. That surely impacts the IT power structure.</p>
<p>IT leadership therefore also requires the skill to navigate the organization through a change in its power structure. Within IT, and increasingly also outside the IT department, tasks and responsibilities shift. That can be painful. Resistance is to be expected.</p>
<p>So what are the new conflicts to be resolved? And what is the mission of the IT leader?</p>
<p>For that, we first need to look at innovation with and within IT.</p>

					<h2 class="headline"><a href="../../../../2015/07/risks-of-virtualization-in-public-and-private-clouds/index.html" rel="bookmark">Risks of virtualization in public and private clouds</a></h2>
					<div class="post_content">
<p>Server virtualization is one of the cornerstone technologies of the cloud. The ability to create multiple virtual servers that can run any operating system on a single physical server has a lot of advantages.</p>
<p>These advantages can appear in public Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) as well as in private clouds.</p>
<p>However, it also brings some risks.</p>
<p>Virtualization reduces the number of physical servers required for a given workload, which brings cost benefits. It also allows for more flexible sizing of computer resources such as CPU and memory. This in turn tends to speed up development projects, even without automatic provisioning. Virtualization can even increase the security of IT because it is easier to set up the right network access controls between machines.</p>
<p>So in order to get the real benefits, steer clear of the risks. A pretty extensive overview of these risks was written by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). You can find it as <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-125/SP800-125-final.pdf" target="_blank">Special Publication 800-125</a>. This article is partly based on that.</p>
<p>Let us first get some of the important concepts straight. The host is the machine on which the hypervisor runs. The hypervisor is the piece of software that does the actual virtualization. The guests then are the virtual machines on top of the hypervisor, each of which runs its own operating system.</p>
<p>The hypervisors are controlled through what is called the ‘management plane’, which is a web console or similar that can remotely manage the hypervisors. This is a lot more convenient than walking up to the individual servers. It is also a lot more convenient for remote hackers. So it is good practice to control access to the management plane.  That might involve using two-factor authentication (such as smart cards), and giving individual administrators only the access that is needed for their task.</p>
<p>An often mentioned risk of virtualization is so-called ‘guest escape’, where one virtual machine would access or break into its neighbor on the same virtual machine. This could happen through a buggy hypervisor or insecure network connections on the host machine. The hypervisor is a piece of software like any other software. In fact it is often based on a scaled down version of Linux, and any Linux vulnerability could affect the hypervisor. However, if you control the hypervisor, you control not just one system, you can control the entire cloud system. So it is of the highest importance that you are absolutely sure that you run the right version of the hypervisor. You should be very sure of where it came from (its provenance), and you should be able to patch or update it immediately.</p>
<h2>The network matters too</h2>
<p>Related to this is the need for good network design. The network should allow real isolation of any guest, so that they will not be able to see any traffic from other guests, nor traffic with the host.</p>
<p>An intrinsic risk of server virtualization is so called ‘resource abuse’, where one guest (or tenant) is overusing the physical resources, thereby starving the other guests of the resources required to run their workloads. This is also called the ‘noisy neighbor’ problem. To address it can require a number of things. The hypervisor might be able to limit the over usage of a guest, but in the end somebody should be thinking about how to avoid putting too many guests on a single host. That is a tough balance to strike: too few guests means you are not saving enough money, too many guests mean you risk performance issues.</p>
<p>In the real world, there are typically a lot of virtual servers that are identical. They run from the same ‘image’, and each virtual server is then called an instance of that image, or instance for short.</p>
<p>Then, with virtual servers it becomes easy to clone, snapshot, replicate, start and stop images. This has advantages, but also creates new risks. It can lead to an enormous sprawl or proliferation of server images that need to be stored somewhere. This can become hard to manage and represents a security risk. For example, how do you know that when a dormant image is restarted after a long time, that it is still up to date and patched? I heard a firsthand story of an image that got rootkitted by a hacker.</p>
<p>So the least you should do is to do your anti malware, virus and version checking also on images that are not in use. Even when you work with a public IaaS provider, you are still responsible for patching the guest images.</p>
<p>In summary, server virtualization brings new power to IT professionals. But as the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

<p>You should worry about the risks of cloud computing. But don’t get too scared. With a few simple steps you can easily get a basic understanding of your risks in the cloud and even have a good start in managing these risks.</p>
<p>If you are a large corporation in a regulated industry, a cloud risk assessment can take weeks or months of work. But even that process starts from simple principles.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I think any risk assessment of a cloud plan should start with the <em>benefit</em> you are expecting from the cloud service. There are two reasons for that. First, the benefit determines the risk appetite. You can accept a little risk if the benefit is large enough. But if the benefit is small, why take any chances?</p>
<p>The second reason is that not realizing the benefit is a risk as well.</p>
<p>For example, if there is a choice between running your CRM system in-house versus in the cloud, you might find that it takes too long to set up the system in-house and it won’t be accessible by sales people in the field. The cloud system will be quicker to deploy and easier to access from outside your company, so the benefit can be realized quicker.</p>
<h2>The first question: what is the data you want to store in the cloud</h2>
<p>Pretty essential in any cloud risk assessment is figuring out what the <em>data</em> is that you want to <em>store</em> in the cloud. Most of the cloud risk management is built on that pillar.</p>
<p>Pay particular attention to data that identifies persons, log files, credit card numbers, intellectual property, and anything that is essential to the conduct of your business. You can easily guess what this means for a CRM system: customers, proposals, contact details.</p>
<h2>The second question then is: what do you want to do with that data?</h2>
<p>How is the cloud provider giving you access to that data? Is the access convenient enough, can you get the reports that you need? In this step you sometimes need to revisit the previous step. For example as you do your reports you figure out that you not only stored customer orders in the cloud, but also your product catalog. So add that to the data that you should worry about.</p>
<p>Once you have a clear idea of the data and the functionality, you can start looking at the value at risk.</p>
<p>Beginning with the data, think about what the worst thing is that can happen to the data. What about it getting lost, or falling into the hands of the wrong people? What about the chance that it is changed without you knowing (maybe by a colleague who happens to have too many access rights)? In my experience, people overestimate the risk of the cloud provider leaking your data, and underestimate the risk of internal people leaking your data.</p>
<p>Similarly, what happens to the business if the data or the reports are not available for some period of time? How long can your business get by without having full access to the data? In the worst case the provider goes out of business. Can you survive the time it takes to set up a new service?</p>
<p>With that general picture in your head, you can start looking at the threats. The top risks are that the cloud provider fails to deliver, and that the cloud provider leaks information.</p>
<p>A little more subtle are the cases where you think they should be doing something, but they don’t. If you use IaaS, you may think that the cloud provider is patching your operating systems. Typically, they don’t. And any backup that the cloud provider makes does not protect you from a provider going out of business. So you want to review your assumptions on who takes care of which risk.</p>
<p>If anything, you should think about which data you still want to use after you stop working with that cloud service. This is easier to do before the cloud provider runs into trouble. Regular data extraction can be fairly simple. If your provider does not make that easy, well, maybe they should not be your provider.</p>

The European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) has produced a very good list of cloud risks. <a href="../../../../2015/05/top-8-cloud-risks-according-to-enisa/index.html" target="_blank">See my earlier blog</a> which also has a brief video on that. For risk assessment purposes I have also created a brief risk triage worksheet.

					<div class="post_content">
<p>The pivotal moment must have been at the end of the first day, as we were sipping a beer on the roadside terrace. But more on that later.</p>
<p>Last week I concluded my 35<sup>th</sup> <a href="../../../../ccsk.1.html" target="_blank">CCSK training</a>. It was great fun, and more importantly, my participants had great fun too. And we could walk everywhere.</p>
<p>An international audience had come to my hometown of Utrecht, and almost half of the participants came from abroad.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.trainspot.nl" target="_blank">training location</a> (Trainspot) is very conveniently located. I can walk to it from my home, it has a bus stop right in front of it and a parking garage a few yards away.</p>
<p>The international visitors admired the city. There are a number of hotels within walking distance and it is also just a short walk to the medieval city center and the typical canals (the one that is called the “new canal” was dug in 1132). After flying into the well connected Amsterdam airport, it is only a half-hour train ride into town.</p>
<p>The group was nicely on time the first day so we could start promptly with a round of introductions. There was a concentration of risk management professionals but some also had good architectural experience. This led to interesting conversations about how to transform companies and make them ready for the cloud mindset, be it public or private cloud.</p>
<p>We had lunch in a different restaurant every day, but all of them are just a short stroll away. It sure helped that it was nicely warm and sunny, so we had lunch outside if the venue permitted. The first lunch was in the park that Trainspot faces. At the end of that day I had proposed a social event in a restaurant (you guessed it: within walking distance) on the Biltstraat. I always enjoy bringing people together in an informal setting, and it definitely set a good atmosphere for the next two days.</p>
<p>We were winding down from the interesting day, getting to know each other a bit more, and the foreigners were really struck by the incessant stream of bicycles passing by our terrace in the commuting hour. It also impressed them to know that the Tour de France would pass within 50 meters of that spot on the following weekend.</p>
<p>The second day brought the start of the practical exercises. In CCSK training we actually build ourselves a working secure application on Amazon Web Services. This is built up in steps as we demonstrate various realistic cloud security controls.</p>
<p>What I also liked was that one of the international participants joined me as a guest at my <a href="http://www.toastmasters.nl/clubs/utrecht/u-speak/" target="_blank">Toastmasters meeting</a> on Tuesday night. When I am abroad I try to visit local Toastmaster meetings. Guests are always welcome. Our Toastmasters motto is to provide a fun and safe environment in which to practice public speaking. In my trainings I try to apply that as well.</p>
<p>Then after three days it was over again, sadly. What remains is the feeling of having been a close-knit group working together, and being part of a community for a few days. In a way that is in great contrast with modern city life where everybody commutes anonymously to work for hours every day. And this holds even stronger in the cloud where we are totally independent of location.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to join me one day in one of these classes. Have a <a href="../../../../calendar.1.html" target="_blank">look at the calendar</a>.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>The most important challenge businesses encounter when it comes to adopting the cloud isn’t security. Yes, security is important; and it’s certainly true that cloud computing introduces new risks, but almost all risks can be adequately catered for. However, that doesn’t happen all the time, and that’s when expensive errors occur.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard from a Dutch company who had lost about a hundred grand in one week through a hack on their IaaS master account. The business model proved to be quite valuable to the intruder: convert 100K machine hours into 20K bitcoins. But these are only juicy details about incidents in the pioneering phase.</p>
<p>The main hurdle I see is the lack of broad vision on the desired benefits of cloud computing. And without a shared view of these advantages, an advance discussion of the risks is meaningless.</p>
<p>A common misconception is that cloud computing is cheaper. That may be so, but it&#8217;s a very mediocre driver of the business case. IT costs seldom decline due to cloud computing. Most of the time, there are missed opportunities.</p>
<p>The majority of the life cycle costs of an IT solution are usually found in the beginning: the implementation process. From then on, keeping an unchanged, existing system online is a limited cost when compared to the whole. Therefore, you can’t cut costs significantly in the final years of a system.  What is seen by the industry as high IT costs; is the cost of new IT. What looks like a simple adjustment or a simple new system to the customer, often proves to be an agony of cost overruns in practice. That’s less well understood, especially as more and more viable alternatives become available in the cloud. The real expected benefit of cloud computing does not involve lowering existing IT costs, but lowering the cost of new IT solutions. That’s how new business comes to life. The more new business is generated, the more new IT should be deployed.</p>
<p>Therefore, step one is about the desired benefits. Each advantage requires its own strategy. The best strategy for lower operational IT costs is often Infrastructure as a Service. The best strategy for faster new IT is mostly new Software as a Service. Only after this choice, should we start talking about risks.</p>

					<div class="post_content">
<p>Does security in the cloud ever bother you? It would be weird if it didn’t. Cloud computing has a lot of benefits, but also a lot of risks if done in the wrong way.</p>
<p>So what are the most important risks? The European Network Information Security Agency did extensive research on that, and identified 35 risk categories. This analysis is used by a number of players in the industry, including certain banking regulators. From those 35, ENISA has selected 8 as the most relevant ones. This article explains them, not in any particular order. (And by the way: ENISA is pronounced as ‘eniesa’, not ‘enaiza’).</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zHO8iMqLy8g?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Loss of governance</h2>
<p>As a cloud consumer you need to be sufficiently in control of your IT systems. If the cloud service agreement does not give you the proper tools, you have a problem. Example: you should be able to make a backup of your important data and get it out of the cloud provider system.</p>
<h2>Lock-in</h2>
<p>Can you move your data and processes from one provider to another? It will always take you effort, but how much? On the infrastructure level it may be fairly straightforward to move to a different provider, but it may be significantly more expensive to move to a different CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system. Don’t get too scared though; remember that most companies have gone through similar projects before there was cloud.</p>
<h2>Isolation failure</h2>
<p>Cloud computing, by definition, is about sharing resources: i.e. processing capacity.  Now if one tenant (cloud word for customer) can influence another’s resources that is considered isolation failure. One example is starving a tenant of CPU power. Another is hacking into another tenant’s virtual machine (which is pretty hard, by the way). A third example is leaking information between tenants, which happened  to DropBox a while ago.</p>
<h2>Compliance risks</h2>
<p>A lot of cloud consumers need to demonstrate that they take proper care of their data, for example because it contains credit card numbers. If your cloud provider does not help you with that, you are in trouble.</p>
<h2>Management interface compromise</h2>
<p>This is another of those ‘risk-speak’ jargon expressions. You probably control your cloud usage through some portal over the internet, which potentially allows a bad guy from anywhere in the world access.</p>
<h2>Data protection</h2>
<p>This is similar to compliance risks. Can you check that all data is handled in a lawful way? Are you sure that their back end providers do the same? Certification can go a long way towards demonstrating that, by the way.</p>
<h2>Insecure or incomplete data deletion</h2>
<p>You are asking your cloud provider to store your data safely, which they probably do by making multiple copies. Then you ask them to delete that same data. That might be hard, as it probably is on multiple disks that are shared with other customers, so they cannot simply shred the hard disks. This problem is not very unique to cloud by the way. You may have it with your own servers, printers and copying machines, all of which contain a lot of storage.</p>
<h2>Malicious insider</h2>
<p>In a cloud provider you have a number of people who may have extreme powers because they can look at all data. One well know ridesharing website had implemented and used a ‘God View’, in which one person could look at all the data.</p>
<p>If you are evaluating cloud solutions, it makes great sense to take a look at each of these eight risk categories first, to see how you and your cloud provider would be handling them. In enough cases cloud providers are demonstrably good enough at this, which you can find out by analyzing their documentation and reports.</p>
<p>More cloud risks are elaborated in the CCSK (Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge)  body of knowledge. The ENISA research is part of that.

					<h2 class="headline"><a href="../../../../2015/03/three-obstacles-cloud-adoption/index.html" rel="bookmark">Three obstacles in cloud adoption</a></h2>
					<div class="post_content">
<p><strong>Don’t</strong> go to the cloud if you see no benefit.</p>
<p>And in a lot of situations there is no benefit in jumping on the cloud band wagon.</p>
<p>But a lot of companies are seeing benefits in cloud, yet they feel constrained in realizing those benefits.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of reasons that we see in reality.</p>
<p>First, there is the fear that security and assurance will be insufficient. This is a very good reason. Even though most data breaches do not occur in cloud environments at this time, that does not mean that that will remain so as cloud adoption grows. At the same time, the potential for having good security in the cloud is very great, mostly. Which leads us to a second reason…</p>
<p>Second, there is lack of understanding of the way assurance can be handled optimally. Large corporations have lots of cloud applications already, in their so-called ‘shadow IT’, but they lack effective procedures to make that compliant. As a result a lot of different solutions exist which escape attention because of the complexity of getting that assurance.</p>
<p>Third, lack of competence in realizing the benefits of the cloud service model. Most essential to the cloud is a service model that allows for a clear separation of responsibilities between a provider and a consumer. (Actually, this is also beneficial for internal IT and private cloud.) The service model is about having more or less standardized service. Consumers that try to impose their own idiosyncrasies on cloud contracts are only shooting themselves in the foot. Providers can fall into the same trap when they try to accommodate different needs of different clients in different ways. It tremendously complicates the internal delivery processes.</p>
<p>A long time ago I transitioned from working at EDS (the big systems integrator that is now part of HP) to a relatively small but pan-European internet provider.  I was amazed by their productivity. They ran systems with 2 to 3 people that would take EDS more than a dozen. It was incredible.  How did they do that?</p>
<p>Well, it was not about the long hours they put in. At EDS people were also doing overtime.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that the internet provider cut corners on quality. Quality challenges were found everywhere in the industry. In fact, the internet provider did more on spam filtering than EDS could at that time.</p>
<p>The big difference was probably that EDS made every solution unique to the customer, and the internet provider only created solutions that would scale across customers. In other words: the internet provider provided a well defined scalable service.</p>
<p>This is the essence of the cloud model. Standardized service leads to lower cost and better quality.</p>
<p>So, in order to realize benefits from cloud applications, you need an understanding of the real risks of cloud computing, have an efficient assurance process and learn to work with standardized services.</p>

					<h2 class="headline"><a href="../../../../2015/02/feature-continuity-cloud-risk-manage/index.html" rel="bookmark">Feature continuity is a cloud risk to manage</a></h2>
					<div class="post_content">
<p>Procurement departments often have an issue with one of the intrinsic characteristics of cloud computing, which is that the provider defines the service. It is not the consumers that define the service, though they may be able to configure it. Is this good or bad?</p>
<p>A procurement department is used to managing service risk by demanding ‘feature continuity’. Once the business depends on a certain feature, like being able to run a certain report, that feature becomes a risk. If it goes away, the business suffers. That is bad.</p>
<p>In software, this risk is often handled by demanding ‘backwards’ compatibility. Cloud providers may not be in a position to provide that. A simple example of that occurs when a security hole needs to be plugged. In addition, the financial attractiveness (which is good) of the service offering might depend on the provider supporting only a very limited amount of different services.</p>
<p>So there are a couple of things that need to be done here. To begin with, the provider’s commitment to certain features and functions should be evaluated. Then, the consumer’s dependence on those functions should be looked at as a risk, and managed as a risk. This means looking at the business implication of a function that goes away, and thinking about workarounds, or other actions.</p>
<p>This cannot be done by the business users or the procurement department alone, they will have to work together. The procurement department probably has better expertise in figuring out provider contract conditions, the business users should be better aware of the risks that they are willing to take in relation to the benefit that they see.</p>
<p>Then, the company will need to return to this analysis on a regular basis, in proportion to the value at risk. And that is part of cloud consumer governance.</p>
<p>This could be part of business continuity management, or disaster recovery planning. Because, even when the provider is still there, lack of support for an essential feature is almost as bad as a provider that has gone away.</p>

					<h2 class="headline"><a href="../../../../2014/12/business-model-canvas-saas-providers/index.html" rel="bookmark">Business Model Canvas for SaaS Providers</a></h2>
					<div class="post_content">
<p>As a follow up to the<a title="Business Model Canvas for Cloud Providers" href="../../../../2014/08/business-model-canvas-cloud-providers/index.html"> earlier article on the IaaS business model</a>, here is a high level overview of the SaaS provider business model and some of the strategic options that are in there.</p>
<h2>Business Model Canvas</h2>
<p>The business model canvas is a visual template for developing and discussion business models. For more information see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas</a> and <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/">http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SaaS-Cloud-canvas.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2902" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SaaS-Cloud-canvas.png" alt="SaaS Cloud canvas" width="480" height="360" srcset="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SaaS-Cloud-canvas.png 960w, http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SaaS-Cloud-canvas-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>The business model canvas has nine basic building blocks and specific relations between those building blocks.</p>
<p>As examples in this article I consider two hypothetical SaaS providers. The first one delivers bookkeeping software, the second one delivers a project collaboration platform.</p>
<h2>Customer segments (CS)</h2>
<p>In the Business Model Canvas, “Customer Segments” are the groups of customers that the company ultimately serves, I.e. the ones that consume and pay for the services. It is characteristic of the SaaS model that this could basically be anybody, not just IT people. Let us just remind ourselves that customers here are the ones that use the service to get their business done, or get their personal lives in order. In a business context we often also have to distinguish between the user and the organization that purchases the solution. This is very likely true in the case of our bookkeeping software company.</p>
<h2>Value Propositions (VP)</h2>
<p>The value propositions reflect the customer problems and needs. This is the central element that describes why the customer would ultimately pay for the product or service.</p>
<p>The essential characteristics of cloud computing may or may not relate directly to the core value proposition of the software application. The core value proposition in our first example, automated bookkeeping, is unrelated to cloud computing. Of course cloud computing’s characteristics give the SaaS proposition an edge above its direct on-premise alternatives even if the functionality would be the same. Self-service provisioning leads to quicker time to deploy, more scalability in usage (whether accounts or transactions), lower investments or commitments, and potentially lower cost.</p>
<p>The value proposition is fundamentally different in the second example, the project collaboration support site. Here the cloud’s characteristic of broad network accessibility is directly driving the usefulness of the software when its users are spread over company boundaries.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the first provider could use this insight to extend its functionality beyond what would be possible in an on-premise solution. Think collaboration with accountants, suppliers and possibly customers, or channel partners.</p>
<h2>Channels (CH)</h2>
<p>Value propositions are delivered to customers through communications, distribution and sales channels.</p>
<p>It is often assumed that cloud computing relies solely on self-service direct sales, but the reality is much more diverse. SaaS providers in particular are developing extensive partner programs.</p>
<p>The typical enterprise software solution is not implemented overnight. It takes attention to change management and alignment on master data for example. That is why system integrators often experience the move from on-premis to SaaS as relatively painless. They are doing the same job on a different environment.</p>
<p>For less invasive offerings, SaaS solutions are often aggregated in broker portals, often nicknamed ‘enterprise app stores’, whose added value is in consolidated billing, self-service provisioning, identity management, and potentially some data integration. But that is one to paint on another business model canvas.</p>
<p>Another natural extension of the SaaS model is exposing the core functionality through an API. While not directly accessed by the consumer, this does allow integration with other SaaS providers. Our project collaboration software could integrate with an existing cloud storage provider.</p>
<p>The main SaaS channels therefore are direct self-service sales, value added re-sellers, system integrators, and enterprise app-stores. The notion of cloud broker fits in here as well, but dissecting its many shapes and forms is a topic beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<h2>Customer Relationships (CR)</h2>
<p>Customer relations are established and maintained with each specific customer segment.</p>
<p>The lure of cloud computing is that the provider can have a much more direct relation with the customer than is possible with an on-premis solution. Technically, the provider can potentially see each and every move from the users. Which software builder would not like to be able to see the popularity of every feature in real-time? This allows for much more rapid innovation cycles. It is not impossible for the loop from idea to wide customer feedback to be closed in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>However, this power can bring the provider in conflict with the consumer who might object to its data being used. As an example that is close to the limit of what might be considered acceptable consider the following case. An on-line bookkeeping service for individuals allows them to categorize payments to merchants. Once enough individuals categorized Danny’s steakhouse as a restaurant, this can then also be suggested to other clients of Danny’s. Is it legal to use data from one cloud consumer to deliver value to another? Generally speaking, the answer is no, but it may be acceptable if only aggregate data is used.</p>
<p>Support is often easier on-line, and on-line communities often add considerable value for the consumer.</p>
<h2>Revenue Streams (RS)</h2>
<p>Revenue streams are the result of value propositions that are successfully offered to customers.</p>
<p>The structure of revenue streams is where cloud computing differs from earlier IT service models. Software firms traditionally relied on licensing arrangements that were somewhat usage based, and could be hard to enforce technically as well as legally.</p>
<p>Cloud computing service models by definition are usage based, and have the potential to be much more closely related to the value that is experienced by the customers. Both our examples enhance the productivity of users, and it is natural to charge per user who has access to the functionality on daily basis. Transactional services such as event management or email delivery are more naturally charged by the transaction, potentially on a bulk basis.</p>
<h2>Key Resources (KR)</h2>
<p>Key resources are the assets required to offer and deliver the previously mentioned elements (e.g. value proposition, customer relationships).</p>
<p>The core asset of a software company is likely to be its code base, its understanding of consumer requirements and processes, and the staff that does this. For a SaaS provider, this is augmented with actual technical service delivery and understanding of consumer behavior.</p>
<p>It may seem a small matter to go from knowing your software and the way it runs at your customer’s sites to running the software yourself. Yet, the competencies involved are fairly different.</p>
<p>The most obvious differences between cloud providers and software delivery companies are in multi-tenancy and feature velocity. Every SaaS provider has to think about how multi-tenant his software needs to be to realize the right scalability model for its customers. Feature velocity, the time between inception and go-live is a great competitive differentiator. To realize it, the provider needs an integrated ‘DevOps’ organization, which asks a lot of people, process and technology.</p>
<p>Then, on the physical asset side, an important question is how much delivery assets the company decided to have. Does it need to own hardware assets or are they sourced from an upstream cloud provider? On the canvas, this represents a trade-off between resource and partnerships.</p>
<h2>Key Activities (KA)</h2>
<p>The key resources perform key activities.</p>
<p>The obvious key activity at a software company is: develop software. In the long run, these should increase the value of the code base. For a SaaS cloud provider, actually delivering the software as a service is an extension to that. The virtuous circle in a SaaS provider is understanding customer behavior and requirements, translating these into new functionality and delivering this to customers.</p>
<p>For this to be successful on the SaaS scale, it has to be executed as an integrated pipeline. The most advanced organizations get the operational activities out of the way. Developers and product managers are empowered to push features to production. Tests are all automated and the focus of operational staff is not so much into bringing features in production, but to maintain the assets and operational fabric that allow the developers to do that themselves.</p>
<h2>Key Partnerships (KP)</h2>
<p>Some activities are outsourced, and some resources are acquired outside the enterprise.</p>
<p>A fundamental choice for every software company is ownership of development tools, as the dependence on these is of strategic importance. That is why large software companies used to have their own homegrown development environments. It turns out that the development tools are a source of strategic risk, but not of strategic advantage. As the industry has matured, it turns out that significant portions of these are best moved to an open source model.</p>
<p>An additional fundamental choice for a SaaS provider is: who runs and owns the delivery infrastructure? Again, that infrastructure represents a risk more than a source of competitive advantage. As Netflix puts it: “we are not in the business of building data centers”. That is why it makes sense to work with IaaS or PaaS providers rather than owning the infrastructure. This will obviously also impact the cost structure as we will see.</p>
<h2>Cost Structure (CS)</h2>
<p>All business model elements discussed above impact the cost structure.</p>
<p>In more traditional IT service models the revenue streams are tightly coupled to the cost structure. The cloud computing innovation is also about decoupling these.</p>
<p>In software, revenue streams are pretty disconnected from the cost structure. After all, when the software is written, shipping it to customers has very low incremental cost, even though servicing customers has not. For software as a service this is a little less so, as there is actual infrastructure supporting the service. The cost of that infrastructure is related to the usage volume.</p>
<p>The most significant cost elements related to software development are in creating and maintaining functionality, and in maintaining the development and delivery infrastructure. For the software delivery side there will be costs related to in company server infrastructure or incurred from key partners such as IaaS providers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, for a lot of SaaS companies, most of the development cost is about supporting future customer needs, not current customer needs. An exception could be the bookkeeping firm, that might be tracking tax regulations as they tend to change regularly.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Again we see the business model canvas as a good tool to map out the particularities of cloud provider business models. It points us to provider particularities and indicates some important strategic choices.</p>
